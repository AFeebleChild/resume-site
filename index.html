        <p class="cover-statement">
            I am seeking a career that fits my skills, personality, and mindset, where I can
            contribute with my skills, and continue to expand my coding and automation skills.
            My biggest asset is the ability to dive into any situation, and become versed enough
            to contribute on the subject in very little time.
